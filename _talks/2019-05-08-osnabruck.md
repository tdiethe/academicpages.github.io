How do we have machines that learn continually, as data arrives? Continual (aka lifelong) learning has gained popularity in recent years in the ML community, in particular methods that try to prevent "catastrophic forgetting" in neural networks. Whilst there are compelling advances in the field, I argue that these are far away from the reality of production environments. In this talk I will present efforts we have been making to bridge this gap, tackling the problem from both research and engineering perspectives.
