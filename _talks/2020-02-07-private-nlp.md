Amazon prides itself on being the most customer-centric company on earth. That means maintaining the highest possible standards of both security and privacy when dealing with customer data. This month, at the ACM Web Search and Data Mining (WSDM) Conference, my colleagues and I will describe a way to protect privacy during large-scale analyses of textual data supplied by customers. Our method works by, essentially, re-phrasing the customer supplied text and basing analysis on the new phrasing, rather than on the customersâ€™ own language.
